build 5 static sites, html/js/css.  they can be whatever you want, but try to keep each one to no more than a day's work.

each one will use a different set of tools, here a list for an idea:

bootstrap,  
pure html/css,  
vanilla js,  
jquery,  
materialize,  
...

learning objectives

debugger,  
chrome devtools,  
be comfortable

give each one a pretty repo and a gh-pages demo.  if you're proud of one put it in your portfolio.
